# Copy Symbol

## Introduction.

Copy_symbol is a simple utility to copy many uncommon symbols to the clipboard. Some highlights include:

* Just sits in the background until you need it.
* Supports over 2000 symbols.
* Very light on system resources.
* Supports multi-letter navigation, allowing you to find any symbol in just a few seconds.
* And much more!

## Main window.

The main window is quite simple, and only made up of a few controls. They are:

* The symbols combo box: This combo box allows you to select a symbol to copy. You can use multi-letter navigation here, so finding symbols is seemeless.
* The copy button: This button coppies the selected symbol to the clipboard. To activate it, you can press Alt+C, or enter from the combo box.
* The exit button: This button allows you to exit the program. It's worth noting that Alt+f4 doesn't exit, simply hides the window. You need to use this if you want to exit completely.

## Hiding and unhiding the window.

Copy_symbol can just sit in the background until you need it. Once launched, you can hide the window with control+win+shift+s, or alt+f4 when in the window itself. Control+win+shift+s also works for unhiding it.

Enjoy!
